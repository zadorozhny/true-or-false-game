          True or False: Flags Game is designed to respect your privacy. We
          collect only the information needed to operate the app, support
          leaderboards, improve stability, and show ads.
        </p>

        <h2>Information we collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Anonymous gameplay data</strong> (scores, regions played,
            mistakes, time taken)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Device and diagnostic data</strong> (app version, OS, crash
            reports, performance data)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ad-related data</strong> (ad impressions, ad interactions,
            and basic device information used to serve and measure ads)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We do <strong>not</strong> ask for your name, email address, phone
          number, contacts, or precise GPS location.
        </p>

        <h2>Advertising</h2>
        <p>
          The app may show ads, including
          <strong>rewarded ads</strong> (optional ads you can watch to earn
          extra games or similar in-app benefits). Ads are provided by
          third-party partners (for example, Google AdMob / Google Mobile Ads).
        </p>
        <p>
          These partners may collect information such as your IP address, device
          identifiers, coarse location (derived from IP), ad interaction data,
          and diagnostic data to serve, limit frequency, measure performance,
          and prevent fraud.
        </p>
        <p>
          On iOS, access to the device’s advertising identifier (IDFA) depends
          on your system settings and, where required, your permission. If you
          don’t allow tracking, ads may still be shown but may be less relevant.
        </p>

        <h2>How we use information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide and improve the game</li>
          <li>Fix bugs and crashes</li>
          <li>Maintain leaderboards and best results</li>
          <li>Show ads and measure their performance</li>
          <li>Prevent fraud and abuse</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-party services</h2>
        <p>
          The app relies on platform services (such as Apple) and third-party
          providers (such as ad networks and backend infrastructure) to operate.
          These services process data according to their own privacy policies.
        </p>

        <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
        <p>
          The app is intended for a general audience. We do not knowingly
          collect personal information from children under 13. Ads may still be
          shown, and ad partners may process limited device information to serve
          and measure ads.
        </p>

        <h2>Your rights</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on your location (GDPR / CCPA), you may request access or
          deletion of stored data. Since the app does not collect account-based
          personal identifiers, requests may be limited. You can also control
          certain ad permissions through your device settings.
        </p>
